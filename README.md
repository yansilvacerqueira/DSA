## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this repository is to provide practical examples and implementations of common data structures and algorithms in different programming languages. This allows:

- Comparing different implementation approaches across languages
- Serving as a reference for studies and consultations
- Demonstrating the particularities and advantages of each language

## 💻 Languages

### Go
- Efficient implementations with focus on concurrency
- Leveraging language native features
- Clean and idiomatic Go code

### JavaScript
- Implementations focused on web and Node.js environments
- Using modern ECMAScript features
- Focus on practical day-to-day applications

### Python
- Clear and Pythonic implementations
- Using language built-in features
- Readable and well-documented code

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/DSA.git
```

2. Navigate to the desired language folder
3. Each implementation contains usage examples and documentation
